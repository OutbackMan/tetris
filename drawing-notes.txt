Various types of LINES create shape, perspective and motion -> SHAPES -> FORM is the 3D aspect 
-> VALUE is the lightness and darkness -> PERSPECTIVE makes image look grounded

Light outline. Darken and refine edges. Smooth edges by drawing lightly near. Move about

Counter lines make up an image (practise this by drawing shape with continual stroke)
When drawing from real life objects, spend more time on studying the object then the drawing.
Cross-contour lines follow the form of the shape.
Always try to include negative space.
Lightly draw simple shapes and then draw over them to create organic shapes.
Line quality, i.e. line thickness creates contrast.
