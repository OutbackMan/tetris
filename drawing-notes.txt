Various types of LINES create shape, perspective and motion -> SHAPES -> FORM is the 3D aspect 
-> VALUE is the lightness and darkness -> PERSPECTIVE makes image look grounded

Light outline. Darken and refine edges. Smooth edges by drawing lightly near. Move about

Counter lines make up an image (practise this by drawing shape with continual stroke)
When drawing from real life objects, spend more time on studying the object then the drawing.
Cross-contour lines follow the form of the shape, i.e show that it is rounded, slanted etc.
Always try to include negative space.
Lightly draw simple shapes and then draw over them to create organic shapes. 
Consider adding outline detail, possible edges, connect shapes together.
Line quality, i.e. line thickness creates contrast. What to do this with value also, i.e shading.
For reflection draw inverse of shape down.
When giving shape form, consider the shape of the 2d edge when extending lines. Rotating/tilting will squash some sides and extend others.
Highlight (leave white), mid, core and cast shadows. Identify where the rises/divets of the object are. Consider how bounce light affects shadow.
Cast shadows typically mimic part of the core shape (will typically fade away).
